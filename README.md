### Main gamemode Description
Prop Hunt: Physical is a forked version of **Prop Hunt** Enhanced (Plus). The main differences being: You are now capable of "Becoming Physical", meaning enabling prop physics to allow for a more immersive hunting experience instead of walking over props to check them.
You're also able to pick up disguised props. This makes the gamemode quite a bit more difficult for the hunters, so it is recommended to have auto-taunt on. Bringing us into another feature difference, auto taunt delay is based on prop size, and has a upper and lower range(cvars) to make smaller props a little less broken.
Another minor change is removing the ability to transform with e, that is done exclusively with left click now, as you can move props around you while physical to affect your surroundings and make your hiding spot better.
